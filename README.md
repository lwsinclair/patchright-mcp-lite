# Patchright Lite MCP Server

A streamlined Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that wraps the Patchright Node.js SDK to provide stealth browser automation capabilities to AI models. This lightweight server focuses on essential functionality to make it easier for simpler AI models to use.

## What is Patchright?

Patchright is an undetected version of the Playwright testing and automation framework. It's designed as a drop-in replacement for Playwright, but with advanced stealth capabilities to avoid detection by anti-bot systems. Patchright patches various detection techniques including:

- Runtime.enable leak
- Console.enable leak
- Command flags leaks
- General detection points
- Closed Shadow Root interactions

This MCP server wraps the Node.js version of Patchright to make its capabilities available to AI models through a simple, standardized protocol.

## Features

- **Simple Interface**: Focused on core functionality with just 4 essential tools
- **Stealth Automation**: Uses Patchright's stealth mode to avoid detection
- **MCP Standard**: Implements the Model Context Protocol for easy AI integration
- **Stdio Transport**: Uses standard input/output for seamless integration

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/patchright-lite-mcp-server.git
   cd patchright-lite-mcp-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the TypeScript code:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Install Chromium-Driver for Pathright:
   ```bash
   npx patchright install chromium
   ```


## Usage

Run the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server with stdio transport, making it ready to integrate with AI tools that support MCP.

## Integrating with AI Models

### Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude-desktop-config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "patchright": {
      "command": "node",
